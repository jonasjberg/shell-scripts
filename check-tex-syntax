# LaCheck manpage info
# --------------------
# DESCRIPTION   LaCheck  is  a  general  purpose consistency checker for LaTeX
#               documents.  It reads a LaTeX document and displays warning
#               messages, if it finds bad sequences. It should be noted, that
#               the badness is very subjective.  LaCheck is designed to help
#               find common mistakes in LaTeX documents, especially those made
#               by beginners.
