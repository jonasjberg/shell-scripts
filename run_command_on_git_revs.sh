  USAGE:  $self_basename [HASH_NEWEST] [HASH_OLDEST] [COMMAND]

  Checks out git revisions from HASH_NEWEST to HASH_OLDEST (inclusive)
  in sequence and executes COMMAND after checking out each revision.
  Note that revision HASH_NEWEST must be more recent than HASH_OLDEST.

  This script exits if COMMAND returns non-zero.  The repository might
  be left in a "detached HEAD" state if COMMAND returns non-zero or is
  terminated by SIGINT (ctrl-c) or any other signal.

  Primary usage for this script is to pass a test runner as COMMAND,
  which allows finding revisions that fail the tests and leaves this
  revision checked out for further examination.
  Prefer using 'git bisect' if the use case doesn't require checking
  out all revisions sequentially!
