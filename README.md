shell-scripts
=============

My very own personal yet still somehow public collection of *nix shell-scripts.


Introduction
------------

This repository contains a subset of my personal shell scripts.

**WARNING:** Handle with *CARE*!
I take no responsability whatsoever for whatever might happen if you decide to
use these scripts, either as is or modified versions.  You are on your own.

This repository is going to see irregular continous modifications ("updates")
and should not be relied upon for any sort of serious work, or anything really.
Don't look at this repository for guidance or reference.

There are great free resources for properly learning shell scripts.
The Linux documentation project might be a good starting point.
