              My very own personal collection of *nix shell-scripts.
              All for private use, but made available to the public.

Introduction
------------
This repository contains a subset of my personal shell scripts.


Caution
-------
Use with *CARE*! I take no responsability whatsoever for whatever might happen
if you decide to use these scripts, either as is or modified versions.
Make sure to double-check everything twice. Develop in some kind of a sandboxed
or otherwise contained environment, perhaps by running a user-account with very
limited privilegies, or by using a dedicated virtual machine, etc.
Don't run experiments on important data. Work with dummy files or backups.
