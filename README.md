=============

My personal yet still somehow public collection of *nix shell-scripts.


Introduction
------------

This repository contains a subset of my personal shell scripts.


Disclaimer

**WARNING: Handle with CARE!**
I take no responsability whatsoever for whatever might happen if you decide to
use these scripts, either as is or as modified versions.  You are on your own.


Don't look at this repository for guidance or reference.  There are great free
resources for properly learning shell scripts.  The Linux documentation project
might be a good starting point.
