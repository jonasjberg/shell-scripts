shell-scripts
=============

Introduction
------------
This repo contains a subset of my *personal* yet still somehow public
collection of `*nix` shell-scripts.

**WARNING:**
I take no responsability whatsoever for whatever might happen if you decide to
use these scripts, either as is or as modified versions.  You are on your own.

Please handle with CARE!

Don't look at this repository for guidance or reference.  There are great free
resources for properly learning shell scripts, like for instance;
